## Class 32: Permissions & Postgresql

### 1) What are the key components and purpose of Django Rest Framework (DRF) permissions, and how do they help in securing an API?

Django Rest Framework (DRF) permissions are essential components that serve the purpose of controlling access and securing APIs built with Django. The key components include IsAuthenticated, which restricts access to authenticated users only, IsAdminUser, which grants access to only admin users, and AllowAny, which allows unrestricted access to all users. DRF permissions help secure an API by enforcing access restrictions based on the user's authentication status, role, or public accessibility. By using these permissions, developers can ensure that sensitive data and actions are protected from unauthorized users, preventing potential security breaches and maintaining the integrity of the API.

### 2) In SQL, what is the purpose of the SELECT statement, and how would you use it to retrieve all columns from a table called ‘employees’?

In SQL, the SELECT statement serves the purpose of retrieving data from a database. It allows users to query and extract specific information from one or more tables. To retrieve all columns from a table called 'employees,' you would use the following SQL query:

SELECT \* FROM employees;

The asterisk (\*) is a wildcard symbol that represents all columns in the specified table. By using this query, you would get a result set containing all the data from every column within the 'employees' table, enabling you to view or manipulate the complete dataset of employee records stored in the database.

### 3) Can you explain the role of DRF Generic Views and provide examples of their usage in building a RESTful API?

DRF Generic Views are a set of pre-built views provided by Django Rest Framework (DRF) that simplify the process of building RESTful APIs by handling common actions and operations such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting objects. These views abstract away much of the boilerplate code, promoting code reusability and maintainability. They are designed to work with DRF serializers to serialize and deserialize data between the API and the database. Examples of DRF Generic Views include ListAPIView for retrieving a list of objects, CreateAPIView for creating new objects, RetrieveUpdateAPIView for retrieving and updating a single object, and DestroyAPIView for deleting a single object. Developers can customize the behavior of these views by overriding certain methods or attributes to meet specific requirements while still benefiting from the standardized API handling provided by the DRF Generic Views. For instance, to create a simple API for managing books, one could use ListCreateAPIView for listing all books and adding new ones and RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView for handling the individual book details, updates, and deletions.
