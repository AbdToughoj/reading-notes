## Class 31: Django REST Framework & Docker

### 1) What are the key components of a Docker container, and how do they help streamline the development and deployment of applications?

The key components of a Docker container are the Docker image, Dockerfile, Docker Engine, Docker container, and Docker registry. Docker images serve as self-contained blueprints with all dependencies, making it easy to reproduce consistent environments. Dockerfiles provide instructions for automating image creation. Docker Engine manages containers, simplifying the process of building, running, and managing applications. Docker containers offer lightweight and isolated environments, ensuring application consistency across different platforms. Docker registries enable easy sharing and distribution of images, promoting collaboration and portability. Together, these components streamline development and deployment by eliminating configuration issues, ensuring consistency, enhancing portability, enabling scalability, and simplifying version control, ultimately accelerating application development cycles and improving reliability.

### 2) Describe the primary steps involved in building a library website using Django, including essential components like models, views, and templates.

Building a library website using Django typically involves several primary steps. First, the developer defines the data models using Django's Model class, representing entities like books, authors, and users. These models determine how data will be stored in the database. Next, views are created to handle user requests and interact with the models to fetch or update data. These views render templates, which define the website's presentation and structure, using data from the models. Templates are written in Django's template language, incorporating HTML and template tags. To ensure a seamless user experience, developers can also implement authentication and authorization mechanisms using Django's built-in authentication system, enabling users to register, log in, and borrow or return books as per their permissions.

### 3) Can you explain the primary differences between Django and Django REST framework?

Django and Django REST framework (DRF) are related but serve different purposes. Django is a full-featured web framework for building web applications, including websites with dynamic content and business logic. It provides a powerful Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system, URL routing, form handling, authentication, and templating. On the other hand, Django REST framework is an extension of Django specifically designed for building Web APIs. It adds features like serializers for data representation, class-based views for handling API requests, authentication classes for API security, and permission classes for controlling access to API resources. DRF allows developers to create RESTful APIs quickly and efficiently, leveraging Django's underlying capabilities while providing additional tools tailored to the needs of API development.
