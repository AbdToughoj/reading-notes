## Class 02

#### 1) Software engineers that use Test-Driven Development (TDD) construct tests for a piece of code before developing the real code. Writing modest, straightforward, testable code that is simple to understand and maintain is the foundation of TDD.

#### 2) Recursion is a programming method where a function calls itself to address an issue. Recursion in Python is accomplished by defining a function that contains a call to the function's own definition. Recursion doesn't cease unless a specific need is satisfied, at which point it ends. To prevent memory problems and stack overflow faults, the base case and recursive case must be properly taken into account.

#### 3) A package in Python is a group of modules arranged in a directory hierarchy, while a module in Python is a single file containing definitions and statements. Create a (.py) file with your code in it to create a module. Make a directory containing a (**init**.py) file and separate (.py) files for each module to construct a package. Use the import statement and indicate the module or function you wish to import in order to use a module or package.
