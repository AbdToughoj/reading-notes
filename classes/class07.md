### Explain the concept of variable scope in Python and describe the difference between local and global scope. Provide an example illustrating the usage of both.

Variable scope in Python refers to the part of a program where a variable can be accessed. The scope of a variable is determined by where it is defined within the code. In Python, there are two main types of variable scope: local and global.

Local scope refers to variables that are defined inside a function or a block of code. These variables can only be accessed within that function or block of code and are not visible to the rest of the program.

Global scope refers to variables that are defined outside of any function or block of code. These variables can be accessed from anywhere in the program, including inside functions.

Here is an example illustrating the usage of both local and global scope:

```
#Global variable
x = 10

def add_numbers(y):
    # Local variable
    z = 5
    return x + y + z

result = add_numbers(15)
print(result)  # Output: 30
```

In this example, x is a global variable that is accessible from within the function add_numbers. The function also defines a local variable z, which can only be accessed within the function. The function then returns the sum of the global variable x, the parameter y, and the local variable z. When the function is called with y equal to 15, the result is 30.

### How do the global and nonlocal keywords work in Python, and in what situations might you use them?

- The global keyword in Python is used to define a variable inside a function as global, allowing it to be accessed and modified from anywhere in the program. It is used by defining the variable outside of any function, and then using the global keyword inside the function to indicate that you want to modify the global variable.

- The nonlocal keyword in Python is used to define a variable inside a nested function as nonlocal, allowing it to be accessed and modified from inside the nested function and the enclosing function, but not from outside of the enclosing function. It is used when you have a nested function that needs to modify a variable from the enclosing function.

Both global and nonlocal variables should be used sparingly, as they can make code harder to read and debug. It is generally best to use local variables within functions, and to pass variables between functions as arguments instead of relying on global or nonlocal variables.

### In your own words, describe the purpose and importance of Big O notation in the context of algorithm analysis.

Big O notation is a mathematical notation that helps analyze and compare the efficiency of different algorithms. Its purpose is to provide a standardized way to measure an algorithm's performance and scalability. It is important because it allows us to make informed decisions about which algorithm to use based on their expected efficiency. By using Big O notation, we can estimate an algorithm's time or space complexity without running it on actual data. This helps in designing efficient algorithms, optimizing code, and predicting how performance will scale with larger input sizes. Big O notation is a valuable tool for algorithm analysis and plays a crucial role in designing scalable and efficient software systems.
