## Class 35: DSA Review

### What are the key pieces of advice mentioned in the “Whiteboard Advice” reading assignment for successfully tackling whiteboard interviews?

1. Plan and Pseudocode: Don't rush into writing code immediately. Plan your approach and outline a high-level pseudocode before diving into the actual implementation.

2. Handle Edge Cases: Ensure that your solution handles edge cases and unusual inputs correctly. This showcases your attention to detail and thoroughness.

3. Stay Calm: Whiteboard interviews can be nerve-wracking, but try to stay calm and composed. Thinking clearly and communicating effectively is key.

4. Ask for Help: If you're stuck or unsure about a particular aspect of the problem, don't hesitate to ask the interviewer for guidance. They may provide helpful hints.

### From the “6 tips to ace a whiteboard programming interview” article, can you identify and explain at least two strategies that can help improve your performance during a whiteboard programming interview?

1. Practice Problem Solving on a Whiteboard: Whiteboard interviews can be a bit different from coding on a computer, so it's important to practice problem-solving directly on a whiteboard or on paper. This practice helps you get comfortable with sketching out diagrams, writing code in a non-interactive manner, and dealing with potential erasing and adjustments. Additionally, practicing on a whiteboard can help reduce the anxiety associated with performing in a slightly different environment than what you might be used to.

2. Use Test Cases to Validate Your Approach: Before diving into writing the complete solution, discuss and use test cases to validate your approach. Testing your algorithm with sample inputs helps catch potential logical errors early on. It also demonstrates your attention to detail and thoroughness to the interviewer. Walk through the test cases step by step, showing how your algorithm works on each example.

3. Break Down the Problem: Break the problem into smaller sub-problems or components. This makes it easier to manage the complexity and gives you a clear roadmap for tackling the problem. Explain to the interviewer how you plan to approach each sub-problem, and consider discussing potential time or space complexity for each part.

4. Ask for Clarifications: If the problem statement is not clear or if you have any doubts about the requirements, don't hesitate to ask the interviewer for clarifications. It's better to clarify any uncertainties upfront rather than making assumptions that could lead you down the wrong path.

5. Clearly Explain Your Thought Process: One of the key strategies is to articulate your thought process clearly as you work through the problem. Instead of jumping straight into writing code, start by discussing your approach, breaking down the problem into smaller parts, and explaining the algorithm you plan to use. This not only demonstrates your problem-solving skills but also gives the interviewer insight into your logical thinking and decision-making process. Remember to vocalize your reasoning, trade-offs, and considerations as you go along.

6. Stay Engaged with the Interviewer: Maintain eye contact and engage in a conversation with the interviewer throughout the interview. This demonstrates your communication skills and shows that you're open to feedback.

### What does Gayle McDowell say about interview preparation in the Engineering Interview Process Deconstructed video?

1. Master Problem Solving Patterns: Learn common problem-solving patterns like brute force, greedy algorithms, and dynamic programming. This will help you quickly recognize the appropriate approach for different types of problems.

2. Review and Learn from Mistakes: After solving problems, review your solutions and learn from your mistakes. Understand why a particular approach worked or didn't work. Continuous improvement is key.

3. Mock Interviews: Conduct mock interviews with friends, family members, or peers. This simulates the interview environment and helps you practice explaining your thought process and receiving feedback.
