## Class16: Serverless Functions

### 1) What are the key characteristics of serverless computing, and how does it differ from traditional server-based architectures?

Serverless computing is a cloud computing model that abstracts away server management tasks, enabling developers to focus solely on building applications. It offers automatic scalability, dynamically adjusting resources to handle varying workloads. The event-driven model triggers application code in response to specific events, promoting modularity and granular development. Pay-per-use pricing ensures cost efficiency by charging only for actual code execution. Stateless functions simplify resource management and support parallel execution. Additionally, serverless computing provides a range of managed services, reducing the burden of infrastructure setup and maintenance. Overall, it simplifies development, enhances scalability, reduces costs, and enables greater agility compared to traditional server-based architectures.

### 2) How can one get started with Vercel, and what are the main steps involved in deploying a serverless function using Vercel?

To get started with Vercel and deploy a serverless function, sign up for an account, install the Vercel CLI, and configure your project. Prepare your serverless function code, define the functions, and export the handler functions in individual files. Deploy the function using the Vercel CLI, test it using the provided URLs, and customize the deployment as needed. Vercel's dashboard allows you to monitor and manage your deployments, view logs, set up alerts, and more. With Vercel, you can quickly deploy serverless functions and focus on developing your application without worrying about server management.

### 3) What are APIs, and how can they be utilized in Python applications to access and manipulate data from external sources?

APIs, or Application Programming Interfaces, facilitate communication between software applications. In Python, APIs can be used to access and manipulate data from external sources by making HTTP requests, parsing JSON or XML responses, authenticating requests, handling pagination and rate limiting, caching responses, and managing errors and exceptions. Python's extensive library ecosystem provides the necessary tools to integrate and consume APIs, enabling developers to interact with diverse services and efficiently retrieve or modify data in their applications.

### 4) What is the Requests library in Python, and how can it be used to interact with APIs by sending HTTP requests? Can you provide an example of a basic GET request using the Requests library?

The Requests library in Python simplifies the process of sending HTTP requests and handling their responses. It provides an intuitive API for interacting with APIs, supporting various HTTP methods and offering features like authentication, cookies, and headers. By using the Requests library, developers can easily send GET requests to APIs, check the response status code, parse JSON data, and handle errors. It is a versatile tool that streamlines API interactions in Python applications.
