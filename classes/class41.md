### Explain the concept of dynamic routes in Next.js and how they differ from static routes.

Dynamic routes in Next.js allow you to create pages with variable segments in the URL, enabling the creation of flexible and parameterized content. These segments are placeholders that capture specific values from the URL, which are then used to render dynamic content on the page. In contrast, static routes generate pages at build time with fixed content, suitable for content that doesn't change frequently. Dynamic routes are generated on-the-fly, either on the server or client side, allowing for personalized and data-driven experiences, while static routes offer faster initial loading and improved SEO benefits by pre-rendering content.

### Describe the process of deploying a Next.js application. What are the key steps involved, and what are some deployment platforms you can use?

Deploying a Next.js app involves building the app using next build. Then, you choose a deployment platform such as Vercel, Netlify, AWS Amplify, or Heroku. Configure settings like repository linking, build commands, and possibly environment variables. Deploy the app, allowing the platform to handle building and hosting. Set up custom domains and ensure SSL/TLS security. Test the deployed app thoroughly, establish monitoring and scaling options, and consider continuous deployment for seamless updates. Regular maintenance is crucial for performance optimization and keeping dependencies up-to-date.

### How does Next.js handle static file serving? Discuss the default folder structure for storing static assets and explain how to reference them in a Next.js application.

Next.js manages static file serving through its "public" directory. By default, static assets like images, fonts, and other resources should be placed in the "public" folder at the root level of your project. Next.js handles these assets as-is, without processing, allowing them to be served efficiently by a CDN. To reference these assets in your application, you can use the public prefix, followed by the relative path to the file from the "public" directory. For instance, if you have an image named "my-image.png" in the "public/images" folder, you can include it in your code using `<img src="/images/my-image.png" alt="My Image" />`. This approach ensures optimal performance and caching for static assets in your Next.js application.
