## **Why we need The Growth Mindset in the IT field?**

### Because it encourages lifelong learning, adaptability, creativity, problem-solving abilities, teamwork, and effective communication, the growth mindset is crucial in the IT industry. These abilities are necessary for success in the intricate and continuously changing sector of IT. A growth mindset can assist people in staying current, approaching obstacles with a positive attitude, collaborating effectively with others, and achieving their professional goals.

### 1) Upgrade Your Technical Skills with Deliberate Practice:

#### You must consciously practice and push yourself beyond of your comfort zone if you want to improve as a programmer. Making software every day won't automatically improve you. Setting difficult goals, getting feedback, and continuously working on particular performance elements are all part of deliberate practice. You must also pick problems that are just a bit beyond your current capability and that need mental effort to solve. Look for tasks that push you to learn new things and put your current skills to creative use. In order to advance your programming abilities, don't be scared to take risks and venture outside of your comfort zone.

### 2) Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset:

#### In her studies on "growth mindset," Carol Dweck examines the notion that our brains are capable of learning and problem-solving. She explores two possible mentalities when confronted with a challenging problem in a TED Talk: the conviction that you lack the intelligence to solve the problem or the belief that you just haven't found the solution yet. The idea of development mentality, which has had a big impact on a number of disciplines, is well-introduced in this talk. Individuals can increase their capacity to learn and acquire new abilities by adopting a growth mindset.

### 3) Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit:

#### According to the "grit" theory of Angela Lee Duckworth, tenacity and enthusiasm for long-term objectives are crucial signs of success. Success, in Duckworth's view, depends not just on talent or intelligence but also on a person's ability to persevere over the long run despite failure and setbacks. She argues that people with grit are more likely to achieve in life and accomplish their goals, despite difficulties. Duckworth has shown via her study that grit, which can be acquired through time, is a more reliable predictor of success than characteristics like IQ or talent.

### 4) Alain de Botton on Redefining Success:

#### According to Alain de Botton, we should reevaluate what success means to us. He argues that the existing social concept of success is restricted to material money, social prestige, and celebrity. De Botton suggests that we reconsider success in terms of our individual skills and passions and how we may use them to benefit society. He contends that rather than focusing on what we believe will impress others, we should instead consider what makes us happy and fulfilled. By doing this, we may build a culture that emphasizes uniqueness and a variety of talents over a single, constrained notion of success.

These skills were honed through reading articles about communication and relationship building.

### 6)Assess your biases. If you have done it in the past, now you can identify the areas you have grown in recently:

#### I've got 78 score, From my weaknesses I try to avoid unfamiliar people or situations, since that’s often uncomfortable, I want to improve myself at this weakness because I think I’m losing a lot of opportunities.
